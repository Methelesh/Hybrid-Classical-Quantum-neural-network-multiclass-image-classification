# Hybrid-Classical-Quantum-neural-network-multiclass-image-classification-using-Transfer-Learning

Three hybrid Classical-Quantum neural networks have been proposed for underwater object identification and classification. Owing to the complex environment of the ocean, live image capturing is tedious and so this research work involves the use of a publicly available sea-animal image dataset that consists of underwater object images. The proposed hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) performed exemplary well even when trained over the available image data of underwater objects. Three pre-trained models were agglomerated with the QCNN to carry forward the task of image classification. Data augmentation was introduced to increase the number of images in the dataset to an increase 25\% by which classification accuracy was observed to improve. The final layers of the pre-trained models were detached and were eventually connected to the quantum CNN circuit.
